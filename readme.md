# inuitcss UI

I â™¥ [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) - this is my base UI layer, that I find myself rewriting between projects.

This repo is scaffolded onto a minimal `yo webapp` ([Yeoman Webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)), with [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) included via `npm`.
